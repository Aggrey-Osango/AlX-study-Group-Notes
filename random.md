4 (1x 10 optional) tasks (3 mandatory x 10 points)

Mandatory:
3 tasks Each 10 points
1. 10 x 100% = 10 points
2. 10 x 100% = 10 points
3. 10 x 65%  = 6.5 points

Optional:
1. 10 x 50% = 5 points

Summary
total points for mandatory = 30
gotten points              = 26.5 / 30
total %age                 = 88.33%

total points for optional  = 10
gotten points              = 5 / 10
total %age                 = 50%
Calculation: 88.33 + (88.33% x 50%) = 132.495%
